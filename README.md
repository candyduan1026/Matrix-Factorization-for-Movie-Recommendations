# Matrix-Factorization-for-Movie-Recommendations
In this project, I will build a model-based collaborative filtering system using MovieLens Datasets. Specifically, I will implement Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD)

Please go to the Jupyter notebook of Matrix Factorization for Movie Recommendations for details.
